        "1. Most of my work in this section was just trying to find a data set that I could access. It may not seem like much to have only gotten a data frame head on my screen, but it represents an epic of digging, proding, and trying to figure out what issues we keeping me from seeing it. Starting in Kaggle, I found an interesting tutorial on machine learning using a populare data set about Irises. I thought I would simply copy out the code the author gave as a sample. After several minutes of not getting it to work, I finally copied and pasted directly. The code still did not work. Finally I figured out that the author was citing a csv file that was likely on his own computer. I then went looking on the internet. Luckily the csv exists on github, but I don't really know how to use that platform yet. After downloading the file to my own computer, I was not able to figure out how to load the csv to my google-native notebook. Then I discovered a button that gave the raw data in a simple html webpage, so I copied the URL. Then I opened the url using read_csv.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. The most interesteting thing I learned was that there are so many open-source sets of data. Unfortantly, they are not exactly ready to use right out of the box. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. For a number of reason, I ran very short on time on this assignment. I didn't really have time to actually manipulate the data before the time to submit came lurking around the corner. I'd like to do SOMETHING with this data, but I think this assignment was mostly about getting to a point where I could figure out how to pull the data to the ready state that all our pre-course data came in. \n"
