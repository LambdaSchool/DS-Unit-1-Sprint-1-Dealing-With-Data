This particular model although not visually stimulating does draw inferences from given variables in order to predict a category of best fit. For example the object could be classified by color given some variables like: hieght, weight, depth, age. This relatively simple block of code when elaborated on could possibly make predictions not that otherwise have remained hidden. \n",
