        "In the project I linked above , I was able to make some loose predictions about the company that I currently work for. We receive monthly profit reports from the CEO. I was able to gather almost 2 years worth of data, and feed it to a linear regression model. Some of the cool libraries I was able to use and learn about were google.colab to import files from my computer, and datetime to convert the dates data to useable variables. This was on top of the skilearn library which houses the linear regression model I used to make the predictions. I wanted to see approximately when cd sales where going to become unprofitable, and when our growth product, books, would intersect and surpass it as a product to keep the company afloat. The linear regression model helps with this goal, as it takes the values I submitted, and creates a line of best fit from that data. You can then trace the line past the data you have to make predictions. At the current rate, cd sales and book sales intersect in October next year, and books will steadily climb into a profitable product while cd sales continue to decline significantly.  \n",

It turns out colab can be a little tricky with that, and apprently a library was created to make this easier. Also, converting the dates to useable data was not trivial. I still need to gain a better understanding of what datetime.toordinal acutally does. \n",

        "\n",
        "Besides the programming aspects of overcoming the above challenges, I learned first hand that the linear regression model is very limited. For instance, the prediction is that cd sales bottom out in 5 years. I find that unrealistic, and actually expect it will plateau at some point and hover well above the zero mark for at least the next decade. \n",
