        "1. I explored a python library called plotly that creates different charts for data visualization. First I went through the library to see what charts were interesting to me. I have been intrigued by how networks behave and wanted to get a sense of how the code looks in order to develop a chart with nodes and edges. Once I found the sample code, I copied it into my notebook to see if it would run. Once I finished trouble shooting the error, I went back to review the code and tried my best to understand what each line of code was doing and the purpose. I had a lot of trouble understanding most of it but noticed that it largely dealt with details of refining the format of the graph. It takes many specific commands to tune all the parameters just for the creation of the chart without even taking into account the insight of the actual data. However it does appear to be reproducible once you can understand how the data should be organized. Next I went through the same process of a 3-D scatter plot. This time I explored more of plotly's functions by trying to edit the chart directly. Through the code, an API is pushed through the Plotly site and onto my notebook which allows me to directly edit data in an easier interface than writing new code to revise it with specific commands. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. The most challenging part was understanding the code. Being new to programming and Python, I am still getting used to recalling some of the syntax and understanding the logic. It was also difficult at first to understand the error and how the library and API connects between the Plotly site and my notebook. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. I learned that there are so many libraries out there that can perform many different functions. It's important at this stage of my learning process to do as much as possible individually to understand the concepts and foundations but the various modeling of data and visualization templates available is very sophisticated and time consuming to re-create. In some instances, once you are signed up to a library, you will be able to access data sets to play around with and also take a look at finished products of graphs that could be applicable in the future. The user interface is also simplified so that non-coders may be able to edit data and the graphs which potentially can be useful for clients and partners that are non-technical or when I am comfortable to start using the shortcuts while understanding the limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. I would like to further explore the connection between datasets and visualization. Certain insights can come to life if is illustrated in the right way. In order to do so, besides having clean data and an applicable model, you have to be able to formulate the data and graph relationship patterns that can bring out the insights. I would like to be able to get a better feel for framing the data in a way that can be most effective to an audience's understanding and also potentially unlock data interdependencies that were previously unnoticed."
