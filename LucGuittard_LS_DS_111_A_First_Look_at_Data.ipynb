I settled on the sub-section devoted devoted to textual analysis and from there looked for some string of code I fealt I could readily reproduce in my CoLab file. This was done mainly as a time constraint for myself; I didn't want to get carried away and bite of more than I could chew for this first assignment. So, I the above code doesn't stray far from its source material. To it, I defined the text variable using a string of text from a novel found at gutenberg.org, and also reset the word or 'item' to be counted (here, 'the') -- chosen after a brief review of the text being analyzed. \n",

In a similar vein, social media posts I feel could be an interesting application of AI. Perhaps volumes of such work are already in the ether. "
