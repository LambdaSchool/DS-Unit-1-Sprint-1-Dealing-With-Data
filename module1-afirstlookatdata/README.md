# First-Look-At-Data PLEASE **DO** READ THIS

Orientation Day Assignment

REQUIRED FILES LOCATED IN https://github.com/amplab/datascience-sp14/raw/master/hw2/hw2data.tar.gz

USED **artists-tags.txt** and **userart-mat-training.csv**

UPLOADING WITHIN GOOGLE COLAB FROM LOCAL SYSTEM TAKES APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES FOR **artists-tags.txt** AND 2-3 MINUTES FOR **userart-mat-training.csv** :/

UNABLE TO SET PATH PROPERLY TO HAVE GOOGLE COLAB READ FILES FROM MY LOCAL SYSTEM (tried multiple methods)

UNABLE TO UPLOAD INTO THIS REPOSITORY DUE TO DATABASE SIZE (.txt file is 58mb)

LINKING FILE VIA GOOGLE DRIVE UPLOAD ALTERS VIABILITY OF DATABASE

WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WITH TL JEFF DANIEL TO NO AVAIL (DETERMINED IT WOULD BE A PYRRHIC VICTORY)
