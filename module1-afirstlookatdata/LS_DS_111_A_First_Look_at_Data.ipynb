    "\n",
    "    I have been working through the \"Deep Learing with Python\" text book which uses keras and tensorflow. I followed instructions to create a convolutional neural net that trains and makes predictions on the mnist dataset. \n",
    "    I tried adding a extra convolutional layer. I found out that caused errors because each layer halves the output space. then i changed the size  of the windows, but this maybe had a miniscule improvement, if anything really changed at all. Changing the batch size did not seem to produce any changes either. I did remove a pooling layer and a convolutional layer and it seemed to max out at the same accuracy as the more complex models, but had better results after fewer epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What was the most challenging part of what you did?\n",
    "    the most challenging part of what i did was figuring out that i could not add more layers to the model, learning that the model halved the output space each time. I still have a hard time picturing what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  What was the most interesting thing you learned?\n",
    "    That reducing the amount of layers and pooling did not negatively affect the performance, but was even a little better after fewer epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  What area would you like to explore with more time?\n",
