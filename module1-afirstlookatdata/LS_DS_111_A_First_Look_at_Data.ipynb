        "\n",
        "2.  What was the most challenging part of what you did?\n",
        "\n",
        "Trying to clarify and concisely summarize the steps of the algorithm I already have in my head. In a traditional calculus class, it's okay to omit steps and leave certain things implicit, but of course when trying to write code to perform automated tasks, we must take care to explicitly include (and carefully document) every step.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What was the most interesting thing you learned?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the pre-course, I played around a bit with different types of regressions, but didn't have a chance to work with Sympy. I'm quite pleased to see how robust it seems to be as a library and set of tools for computing all sorts of interesting things.\n",

        "4.  What area would you like to explore with more time?\n",
        "\n",
        "I would definitely like to make the snippet a bit more robust in the future; it would be nice if the snippet computed some approximations for other types of series. It would be even better to see if I could come up with a method to test other types of series for convergence. \n",
        "\n",
        "I decided to go with series convergence because, in my experience, it's one of the more difficult things to explain in calculus. Understanding how to tell when a series converges or diverges (or when we can't say for sure) relies, at least at the level of most students, on a level of intuition that can only really be gained by working lots and lots of problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "But, at least in principle, our brains are themselves but (extremely computationally efficient) machines, and our intuition but an algorithm implicitly derived from our experiences. We ought, then, to be able to slow down our thought processes and record each step carefully. Solving math problems, though more difficult for most of us humans than, say, recognizing an animal as a cat, a dog, or neither, ought to be simpler to implement in a computer than would an algorithm to differentiate between animals. As we progress through the course, I'd like to spend more time thinking about and practicing the translation of my intuitive understanding of things into computable algorithms and, hopefully, vice-versa.\n",
