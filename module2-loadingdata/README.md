Did both the Adult Census data(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) used within lecture (took it further by actually creating the plots) and the Wine data(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). Both from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Created new columns for ">50K" and for "female" to allow binary values which could be plotted with.
